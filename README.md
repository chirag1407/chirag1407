## 👨‍💻 About Me

I love building systems that are fast, reliable, and clean.  
Most of my work revolves around **backend engineering**, **API design**, and solving those tricky performance or data-flow problems that nobody else wants to touch 😅.

I enjoy:
- Designing scalable service architectures  
- Turning messy workflows into elegant backend logic  
- Debugging complex issues across logs, services, and databases  
- Experimenting with GenAI tools (RAG, embeddings, internal assistants)  
- Automating things that shouldn’t be manual  

If it involves **good engineering**, I’m in.
